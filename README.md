Real-Time Pose Estimation using Mediapipe

Overview:
This project is designed to perform real-time pose estimation, providing a foundational step toward pose classification. Using Mediapipe, a powerful library by Google, this project is capable of detecting human body landmarks in real-time. Pose estimation serves as the basis for solving various real-world problems, such as expression detection, activity monitoring, and more. This technology is also highly effective in emerging fields such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR), where precise body tracking is essential.

Features:
- Real-time pose estimation: Detects human body landmarks with high accuracy.
- Versatile application: Can be extended to solve problems like expression detection, fitness tracking, and motion monitoring.
- Emerging technology support: Enhances experiences in AR/VR by providing precise body pose tracking.
- Lightweight and fast: Utilizes Mediapipe’s efficient processing pipeline for real-time performance on most devices.

 Technologies Used
- Python: The programming language used for this project.
- Mediapipe: A cross-platform library by Google for real-time perception across various devices.
- OpenCV: Used for video capture and processing.
  
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/dipan313/real-time-pose-estimation.git
   
3. Install the required libraries:
   pip install mediapipe opencv-python
   
4. Run the pose estimation script:
   python pose_estimation.py
   
   The program will open your device's camera and start detecting the human body pose in real-time.

 Code Explanation:
- The code initializes the Mediapipe Pose model, which tracks 33 body landmarks.
- OpenCV captures video input from the camera.
- For each frame, the pose detection algorithm processes the image and draws landmarks on the detected human body.

 Example Use Cases:
- Expression detection: Recognize emotions based on body language.
- Posture correction: Monitor body posture for fitness and rehabilitation.
- AR/VR integration: Enhance immersive experiences by detecting user movement in real-time.

 Future Work:
- Pose classification: Add machine learning models to classify various poses (e.g., yoga poses, dance steps).
- Cross-device support: Optimize for use in mobile applications.
- Integration with AR/VR systems: Apply pose estimation for interaction in virtual environments.
